# US Census Data Visualization
### Tableau project from Udacity utilizing US Census Data from Kaggle  

In this project, I used the US Census Data and saw two key patterns. One dealing with gender and the other with traffic in a specific subset of the country and how income and poverty affects it. In all the graphs, they are filterable and interactive across the visualization. 

I included a small write up briefly explaining my thoughts on the pattern and my thoughts on design choices, which is shown here in a pdf. 

I have also included the downloaded versions of my visualizations as well as jpg. versions for ease of access.
